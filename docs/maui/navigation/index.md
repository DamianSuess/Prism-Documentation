# Getting Started

When we talk about Navigation for Prism.Maui we are specifically referring to Page based Navigation. 

! INFO Info
    Prism.Maui currently only supports Page based Navigation. We do not have plans to ever support Shell. After extensive review we feel that Shell is fundamentally flawed and should not be used. Shell was ultimately a poorly implemented attempt from the Xamarin team to copy Prism's URI based navigation. You can build much richer more dynamic applications with Prism's Navigation Service without the headache of Shell.
